# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Implemented a python script to extract tweets using Twitter API (Tweepy). 
Tweets were then processed and segmented into negative, positive and neutral(TextBlob) using K Means Algorithm while counting the most frequently used words in each 
sentiment type. (Python (Numpy, Tweepy, Text Blob, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Pandas, WordCloud))
Visualization of the Analysis.
